Overview
The Pizza Sales Analysis project aims to analyze a dataset of pizza sales to uncover insights that will help track the 
performance of the pizza business. By utilizing SQL queries, we examined various facets of the data, including the most ordered pizza types, 
sales trends, customer preferences, and other important metrics. This analysis serves to inform decision-making and improve marketing strategies
for the pizza business.

Objectives
Identify Best-Selling Pizza Types: Determine which pizzas are the most popular among customers based on order frequency.
Sales Trend Analysis: Analyze sales data over time to identify trends, peak sales periods, and seasonality.
Customer Preferences: Explore customer order patterns to understand preferences regarding pizza toppings, sizes, and additional items.
Geographic Insights: Investigate any geographical trends in sales to assess where marketing efforts may be most effective.
Performance Metrics: Calculate key performance metrics such as average order value, total sales, and customer retention.

Key Findings
Most Ordered Pizza:

Utilized SQL queries to find the pizza type that had the highest order count.
